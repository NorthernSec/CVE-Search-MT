## CVE-Search - Management Tools (CVE-Search-MT)

This is a list of management tools for CVE-Search that might or might not be useful for you.
This list is in development, and will grow in time. These scripts are developed to perform tasks I personally need, so they might not fit your requirements.
However, I will try to maintain a reasonable standard, and I encourage you to hack onto existing scripts and add new ones, to help this repository grow.

### Tools

* **db_dump_month.py** - dump a list of CVEs you might have missed during a specific month.
* **db_dump_day.py** - dump the CVEs of one day (default today) and allow grouping. Very useful for patch releases.

### Libraries

* **Config.py** - Read configurations from the configurations.ini file
